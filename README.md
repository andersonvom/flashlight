### Flashlight App

This flashlight app was created to be minimalistic and simple: no fancy options, no excessive permissions (like accessing your contacts or using 3G/wifi data). It does what the name says: turns your phone into a flashlight. Turns the camera flash on/off. That's it. There's no catch!

It also provides a widget, so that (phone permitting) you can quickly access it from your lock screen in case of an emergency.

### Usage

Click the icon or the widget. =)  
Click it again (now inside the app) to turn it off.

### Preferences

* Do not turn off on Power Button  
Keeps the flashlight on even after pressing the power button and locking the screen (to save precious battery if you're running out of it)
